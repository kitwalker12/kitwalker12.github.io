You have reached the mothership of Aditya Raghuwanshi.

When I’m not fighting Separatist Scum, I’m the Director of Engineering at [VioletGrey Inc.](http://www.violetgrey.com) where I work on their curated eCommerce website. I’m a Ruby on Rails developer by trade and have developed websites using PHP/MySQL/HTML5/CSS3/Jquery as well. I graduated from USC in 2013, specializing in Computer Networks. I’ve also worked with Citrix Systems for 3 years as a Software Engineer.

I love Comics, Photoshop & just doodling in general.

This is my blog/pastebin.

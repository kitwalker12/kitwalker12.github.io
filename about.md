You have reached the mothership of Aditya Raghuwanshi.

When I’m not fighting Separatist Scum, I’m employed at VioletGrey Inc. where I developing their e-com website. I’m a Ruby on Rails developer by trade and have developed websites using PHP/MySQL/HTML5/CSS3/Jquery as well. I graduated from USC in 2013, specializing in Computer Networks. I’ve also worked with Citrix Systems for 3 years as a Software Engineer.

I love Comics, Photoshop & just doodling in general.

This is my blog/pastebin.

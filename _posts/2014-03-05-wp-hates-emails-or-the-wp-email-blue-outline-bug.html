<p>Just a little rant I need to do. I was trying to write an HTML email (you know, the beyond ugly ones with tables and tables within tables and inline styles). All was going well, when I saw that on my Windows Phone, all my images which were links had a blue border around them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-112 aligncenter" alt="screeshot" src="../assets/wp_ss_20140305_0001-259x300.png" width="259" height="300" /></p>
<p>I looked around for a solution, and sure enough dozens of users had the same problem. The fix was (supposed to be) simple. Just put a</p>
<pre>
  <p>border: none;</p>
  <p>outline: none;</p>
</pre>
<p>on the image. Ofcourse, that didn't help. I tried inlining that into the a tag, the img tag, the outer td, tr &amp; table but nothing worked.</p>
<p>Finally <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/16178193/1013444" target="_blank">this comment at stackoverflow</a> helped me out. Apparently "IE adds a border around images if theyâ€™re the child of an anchor". So adding</p>
<pre>
<p>a img {</p>
<p>border: none;</p>
<p>}</p>
</pre>
<p>in the css fixed it. Goddamn you IE for mobile...Goddamn you.</p>

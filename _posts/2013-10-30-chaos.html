<p>Oh the vagaries of the english language...</p>
<h1>"The Chaos"</h1>
<blockquote><p>by G. Nolst Trenite' a.k.a. "Charivarius" 1870 - 1946</p></blockquote>
<p>Dearest creature in creation<br />
Studying English pronunciation,<br />
I will teach you in my verse<br />
Sounds like corpse, corps, horse and worse.</p>
<p>I will keep you, Susy, busy,<br />
Make your head with heat grow dizzy;<br />
Tear in eye, your dress you'll tear;<br />
Queer, fair seer, hear my prayer.</p>
<p>Pray, console your loving poet,<br />
Make my coat look new, dear, sew it!<br />
Just compare heart, hear and heard,<br />
Dies and diet, lord and word.</p>
<p>Sword and sward, retain and Britain<br />
(Mind the latter how it's written.)<br />
Made has not the sound of bade,<br />
Say-said, pay-paid, laid but plaid.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Now I surely will not plague you<br />
With such words as vague and ague,<br />
But be careful how you speak,<br />
Say: gush, bush, steak, streak, break, bleak,</p>
<p>Previous, precious, fuchsia, via<br />
Recipe, pipe, studding-sail, choir;<br />
Woven, oven, how and low,<br />
Script, receipt, shoe, poem, toe.</p>
<p>Say, expecting fraud and trickery:<br />
Daughter, laughter and Terpsichore,<br />
Branch, ranch, measles, topsails, aisles,<br />
Missiles, similes, reviles.</p>
<p>Wholly, holly, signal, signing,<br />
Same, examining, but mining,<br />
Scholar, vicar, and cigar,<br />
Solar, mica, war and far.</p>
<p>From "desire": desirable – admirable from "admire",<br />
Lumber, plumber, bier, but brier,<br />
Topsham, brougham, renown, but known,<br />
Knowledge, done, lone, gone, none, tone,</p>
<p>One, anemone, Balmoral,<br />
Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel.<br />
Gertrude, German, wind and wind,<br />
Beau, kind, kindred, queue, mankind,</p>
<p>Tortoise, turquoise, chamois-leather,<br />
Reading, Reading, heathen, heather.<br />
This phonetic labyrinth<br />
Gives moss, gross, brook, brooch, ninth, plinth.</p>
<p>Have you ever yet endeavoured<br />
To pronounce revered and severed,<br />
Demon, lemon, ghoul, foul, soul,<br />
Peter, petrol and patrol?</p>
<p>Billet does not end like ballet;<br />
Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.<br />
Blood and flood are not like food,<br />
Nor is mould like should and would.</p>
<p>Banquet is not nearly parquet,<br />
Which exactly rhymes with khaki.<br />
Discount, viscount, load and broad,<br />
Toward, to forward, to reward,</p>
<p>Ricocheted and crocheting, croquet?<br />
Right! Your pronunciation's OK.<br />
Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,<br />
Friend and fiend, alive and live.</p>
<p>Is your r correct in higher?<br />
Keats asserts it rhymes Thalia.<br />
Hugh, but hug, and hood, but hoot,<br />
Buoyant, minute, but minute.</p>
<p>Say abscission with precision,<br />
Now: position and transition;<br />
Would it tally with my rhyme<br />
If I mentioned paradigm?</p>
<p>Twopence, threepence, tease are easy,<br />
But cease, crease, grease and greasy?<br />
Cornice, nice, valise, revise,<br />
Rabies, but lullabies.</p>
<p>Of such puzzling words as nauseous,<br />
Rhyming well with cautious, tortious,<br />
You'll envelop lists, I hope,<br />
In a linen envelope.</p>
<p>Would you like some more? You'll have it!<br />
Affidavit, David, davit.<br />
To abjure, to perjure. Sheik<br />
Does not sound like Czech but ache.</p>
<p>Liberty, library, heave and heaven,<br />
Rachel, loch, moustache, eleven.<br />
We say hallowed, but allowed,<br />
People, leopard, towed but vowed.</p>
<p>Mark the difference, moreover,<br />
Between mover, plover, Dover.<br />
Leeches, breeches, wise, precise,<br />
Chalice, but police and lice,</p>
<p>Camel, constable, unstable,<br />
Principle, disciple, label.<br />
Petal, penal, and canal,<br />
Wait, surmise, plait, promise, pal,</p>
<p>Suit, suite, ruin. Circuit, conduit<br />
Rhyme with "shirk it" and "beyond it",<br />
But it is not hard to tell<br />
Why it's pall, mall, but Pall Mall.</p>
<p>Muscle, muscular, gaol, iron,<br />
Timber, climber, bullion, lion,<br />
Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair,<br />
Senator, spectator, mayor,</p>
<p>Ivy, privy, famous; clamour<br />
Has the a of drachm and hammer.<br />
Pussy, hussy and possess,<br />
Desert, but desert, address.</p>
<p>Golf, wolf, countenance, lieutenants<br />
Hoist in lieu of flags left pennants.<br />
Courier, courtier, tomb, bomb, comb,<br />
Cow, but Cowper, some and home.</p>
<p>"Solder, soldier! Blood is thicker",<br />
Quoth he, "than liqueur or liquor",<br />
Making, it is sad but true,<br />
In bravado, much ado.</p>
<p>Stranger does not rhyme with anger,<br />
Neither does devour with clangour.<br />
Pilot, pivot, gaunt, but aunt,<br />
Font, front, wont, want, grand and grant.</p>
<p>Arsenic, specific, scenic,<br />
Relic, rhetoric, hygienic.<br />
Gooseberry, goose, and close, but close,<br />
Paradise, rise, rose, and dose.</p>
<p>Say inveigh, neigh, but inveigle,<br />
Make the latter rhyme with eagle.<br />
Mind! Meandering but mean,<br />
Valentine and magazine.</p>
<p>And I bet you, dear, a penny,<br />
You say mani-(fold) like many,<br />
Which is wrong. Say rapier, pier,<br />
Tier (one who ties), but tier.</p>
<p>Arch, archangel; pray, does erring<br />
Rhyme with herring or with stirring?<br />
Prison, bison, treasure trove,<br />
Treason, hover, cover, cove,</p>
<p>Perseverance, severance. Ribald<br />
Rhymes (but piebald doesn't) with nibbled.<br />
Phaeton, paean, gnat, ghat, gnaw,<br />
Lien, psychic, shone, bone, pshaw.</p>
<p>Don't be down, my own, but rough it,<br />
And distinguish buffet, buffet;<br />
Brood, stood, roof, rook, school, wool, boon,<br />
Worcester, Boleyn, to impugn.</p>
<p>Say in sounds correct and sterling<br />
Hearse, hear, hearken, year and yearling.<br />
Evil, devil, mezzotint,<br />
Mind the z! (A gentle hint.)</p>
<p>Now you need not pay attention<br />
To such sounds as I don't mention,<br />
Sounds like pores, pause, pours and paws,<br />
Rhyming with the pronoun yours;</p>
<p>Nor are proper names included,<br />
Though I often heard, as you did,<br />
Funny rhymes to unicorn,<br />
Yes, you know them, Vaughan and Strachan.</p>
<p>No, my maiden, coy and comely,<br />
I don't want to speak of Cholmondeley.<br />
No. Yet Froude compared with proud<br />
Is no better than McLeod.</p>
<p>But mind trivial and vial,<br />
Tripod, menial, denial,<br />
Troll and trolley, realm and ream,<br />
Schedule, mischief, schism, and scheme.</p>
<p>Argil, gill, Argyll, gill. Surely<br />
May be made to rhyme with Raleigh,<br />
But you're not supposed to say<br />
Piquet rhymes with sobriquet.</p>
<p>Had this invalid invalid<br />
Worthless documents? How pallid,<br />
How uncouth he, couchant, looked,<br />
When for Portsmouth I had booked!</p>
<p>Zeus, Thebes, Thales, Aphrodite,<br />
Paramour, enamoured, flighty,<br />
Episodes, antipodes,<br />
Acquiesce, and obsequies.</p>
<p>Please don't monkey with the geyser,<br />
Don't peel 'taters with my razor,<br />
Rather say in accents pure:<br />
Nature, stature and mature.</p>
<p>Pious, impious, limb, climb, glumly,<br />
Worsted, worsted, crumbly, dumbly,<br />
Conquer, conquest, vase, phase, fan,<br />
Wan, sedan and artisan.</p>
<p>The th will surely trouble you<br />
More than r, ch or w.<br />
Say then these phonetic gems:<br />
Thomas, thyme, Theresa, Thames.</p>
<p>Thompson, Chatham, Waltham, Streatham,<br />
There are more but I forget 'em -<br />
Wait! I've got it: Anthony,<br />
Lighten your anxiety.</p>
<p>The archaic word albeit<br />
Does not rhyme with eight-you see it;<br />
With and forthwith, one has voice,<br />
One has not, you make your choice.</p>
<p>Shoes, goes, does. Now first say: finger;<br />
Then say: singer, ginger, linger.<br />
Real, zeal, mauve, gauze and gauge,<br />
Marriage, foliage, mirage, age,</p>
<p>Hero, heron, query, very,<br />
Parry, tarry fury, bury,<br />
Dost, lost, post, and doth, cloth, loth,<br />
Job, Job, blossom, bosom, oath.</p>
<p>Faugh, oppugnant, keen oppugners,<br />
Bowing, bowing, banjo-tuners<br />
Holm you know, but noes, canoes,<br />
Puisne, truism, use, to use?</p>
<p>Though the difference seems little,<br />
We say actual, but victual,<br />
Seat, sweat, chaste, caste, Leigh, eight, height,<br />
Put, nut, granite, and unite.</p>
<p>Reefer does not rhyme with deafer,<br />
Feoffer does, and zephyr, heifer.<br />
Dull, bull, Geoffrey, George, ate, late,<br />
Hint, pint, senate, but sedate.</p>
<p>Gaelic, Arabic, pacific,<br />
Science, conscience, scientific;<br />
Tour, but our, dour, succour, four,<br />
Gas, alas, and Arkansas.</p>
<p>Say manoeuvre, yacht and vomit,<br />
Next omit, which differs from it<br />
Bona fide, alibi<br />
Gyrate, dowry and awry.</p>
<p>Sea, idea, guinea, area,<br />
Psalm, Maria, but malaria.<br />
Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean,<br />
Doctrine, turpentine, marine.</p>
<p>Compare alien with Italian,<br />
Dandelion with battalion,<br />
Rally with ally; yea, ye,<br />
Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, key, quay!</p>
<p>Say aver, but ever, fever,<br />
Neither, leisure, skein, receiver.<br />
Never guess – it is not safe,<br />
We say calves, valves, half, but Ralf.</p>
<p>Starry, granary, canary,<br />
Crevice, but device, and eyrie,<br />
Face, but preface, then grimace,<br />
Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass.</p>
<p>Bass, large, target, gin, give, verging,<br />
Ought, oust, joust, and scour, but scourging;<br />
Ear, but earn; and ere and tear<br />
Do not rhyme with here but heir.</p>
<p>Mind the o of off and often<br />
Which may be pronounced as orphan,<br />
With the sound of saw and sauce;<br />
Also soft, lost, cloth and cross.</p>
<p>Pudding, puddle, putting. Putting?<br />
Yes: at golf it rhymes with shutting.<br />
Respite, spite, consent, resent.<br />
Liable, but Parliament.</p>
<p>Seven is right, but so is even,<br />
Hyphen, roughen, nephew, Stephen,<br />
Monkey, donkey, clerk and jerk,<br />
Asp, grasp, wasp, demesne, cork, work.</p>
<p>A of valour, vapid vapour,<br />
S of news (compare newspaper),<br />
G of gibbet, gibbon, gist,<br />
I of antichrist and grist,</p>
<p>Differ like diverse and divers,<br />
Rivers, strivers, shivers, fivers.<br />
Once, but nonce, toll, doll, but roll,<br />
Polish, Polish, poll and poll.</p>
<p>Pronunciation - think of Psyche! -<br />
Is a paling, stout and spiky.<br />
Won't it make you lose your wits<br />
Writing groats and saying "grits"?</p>
<p>It's a dark abyss or tunnel<br />
Strewn with stones like rowlock, gunwale,<br />
Islington, and Isle of Wight,<br />
Housewife, verdict and indict.</p>
<p>Don't you think so, reader, rather,<br />
Saying lather, bather, father?<br />
Finally, which rhymes with enough,<br />
Though, through, bough, cough, hough, sough, tough??<br />
Hiccough has the sound of sup...<br />
My advice is: GIVE IT UP!</p>

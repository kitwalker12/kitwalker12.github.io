<p>Today I published my first Ruby Gem on rubygems.org</p>
<p>I've made gems before, mainly extensions to the Spree E-Commerce platform, but this was the first time I went through the correct process of building it from scratch, doing CI integration and all that jazz.</p>
<p>It's a small tool, which lets you get start and end dates of periods in a financial calendar used by the retail industry. Detailed Information can be found <a title="here" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%934%E2%80%935_calendar" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, I've published it here: <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/retail_calendar" target="_blank">https://rubygems.org/gems/retail_calendar</a></p>
<p>The code is open-source and available here: <a href="https://github.com/kitwalker12/retail_calendar" target="_blank">https://github.com/kitwalker12/retail_calendar</a></p>
<p>Feel free to <a href="http://github.com/kitwalker12/retail_calendar/fork" target="_blank">fork</a> and contribute. Hope anyone finds it useful.</p>

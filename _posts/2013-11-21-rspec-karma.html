<p>I'm a RoR developer and recently was working on implementing an image manipulation feature in our app. I've gotten into the habit of TDD and naturally I started out by developing tests for my new class that'll handle the features.</p>
<p>This is what my test looked like in <code>spec/lib/image_publisher_spec.rb</code></p>
<pre><code>require "spec_helper"

describe ImagePublisher do

  let(:ip) { ImagePublisher.new }

  describe "#validate" do
    #...
  end
  #...
end
</code></pre>
<p>and I put the actual library in <code>lib/image_publisher.rb</code></p>
<pre><code>class ImagePublisher
  attr_accessor #...

  def initialize
      #...
  end

  def validate(path)
    #...
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>After developing some tests and implementing the features I had <code>rspec spec/lib/image_publisher_spec.rb</code> passing. Confident in my abilities, I ran the whole suite with <code>rspec</code> and was met with the first shocker of the day. My new test was passing fine but another feature spec I had written earlier was failing at the <code>before (:each)</code> level with the error:</p>
<pre><code>ActionController::RoutingError:
      uninitialized constant AdminDashboardController
</code></pre>
<p>To clarify, I'm using <a href="http://www.activeadmin.info/">Active Admin</a> (which incidentally hasn't been my staunchest ally in my conversion to Rails 4) and spec which started failing suddenly was this:</p>
<pre><code>    #spec/features/publish_flow_spec.rb
require "spec_helper"

feature "Publish Flow" do

  let(:admin_user) { FactoryGirl.create(:admin_user) }

  before(:each) do
    sign_in_user admin_user
  end

  def sign_in_user(user)
    visit root_path
    fill_in 'admin_user_email', with: user.email
    fill_in 'admin_user_password', with: user.password
    click_button 'Login'
  end

  describe "some feature" do
      it "does something" do
          #...
      end
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>The failure point was the line <code>visit root_path</code> and it appears the runtime couldn't find <code>Admin::DashboardController</code> as it seemed to be interpreting it as <code>AdminDashboardController</code>. What was weird was that running <code>rspec spec/features/publish_flow_spec.rb</code> didn't produce any errors and passed like it did before.</p>
<p>Quickly googling the error, I found many users facing the same dilemma and I tried the fixes they offered one by one. Here's my account.</p>

<p>My gem file looked something like this.</p>
<pre><code>source 'https://rubygems.org'
ruby "2.0.0"

gem 'rails', '4.0.0'

gem 'pg'

    #...
gem 'activeadmin', :github =&gt; 'gregbell/active_admin'
    #...
</code></pre>
<p>and the routes like this</p>
<pre><code>MyApp::Application.routes.draw do
  root :to =&gt; 'admin/dashboard#index'
  devise_for :admin_users, ActiveAdmin::Devise.config
  ActiveAdmin.routes(self)
end
</code></pre>
<p>I moved the root definition above ActiveAdmin's definition but that didn't help. I even tried specifying my name space by <code>config.default_namespace = :admin</code> even though I was using the default namespace already, but it still didn't stop the old spec from failing.</p>
<h3 id="tryingfix2httpsgithubcomgregbellactive_adminissues787"><a href="https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin/issues/787/">Trying Fix #2</a></h3>
<p>It seemed it may be an active admin issue, and I tried the fix specified in a related github issue. Sadly, specifying <code>config.cache_classes = true</code> in my <code>application.rb</code> didn't resolve the failing test either.</p>
<h3 id="tryingfix345">Trying Fix #3, #4, #5....</h3>
<p>At this point I'd played around with enabling and disabling various permutations of config variables in <code>application.rb</code>, <code>test.rb</code> &amp; <code>active_admin.rb</code> and after spending a couple of hours, nothing seemed to work. I just couldn't understand why the test would fail when run with the whole suite and not when run independently.</p>
<p>I even tried specifying different routes (which were valid because I could see them at <code>http://localhost:3000/rails/info/routes</code>) in the <code>sign_in_user</code> function but they all failed with routing errors.</p>
<p>I also thought maybe the test db was at fault but running <code>rake db:test:prepare</code> didn't solve anything.</p>
<h3 id="tryingfix4">Trying Fix #4</h3>
<p>I decided to go back to a working commit which had passed all the tests before I added my new class. Here, the test seemed to work fine when run as a whole. I figured it had something to do with the <code>ImagePublisher</code> class I had recently created. I moved back to the most recent commit and removed <code>rspec spec/lib/image_publisher_spec.rb</code> and VOILA, the whole suite is passing again.</p>
<h3 id="whatfixedit">What fixed it?</h3>
<p>Now I knew that something was wrong with the new test that I had written but couldn't figure out how it was meddling with a completely unrelated test. I decided to go back to the basics and searched for a tutorial on how to write spec tests for a class in the <code>lib</code> folder.</p>
<p>An example listed at <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/ruby-for-newbies-testing-with-rspec/">this site</a> gave this example:</p>
<pre><code>require 'spec_helper'

describe "Library object" do

    before :all do
        lib_obj = [
            Book.new("JavaScript: The Good Parts", "Douglas Crockford", :development),
            Book.new("Designing with Web Standards", "Jeffrey Zeldman", :design),
            Book.new("Don't Make me Think", "Steve Krug", :usability),
            Book.new("JavaScript Patterns", "Stoyan Stefanov", :development),
            Book.new("Responsive Web Design", "Ethan Marcotte", :design)
        ]
        File.open "books.yml", "w" do |f|
            f.write YAML::dump lib_obj
        end
    end

    before :each do
        @lib = Library.new "books.yml"
    end

end
</code></pre>
<p>Hmmm...I don't know what I'm doing different but all I see is that the main describe block name as encapsulated in quotes. So that's what I decided to do:</p>
<pre><code>Diff
-describe ImagePublisher do
+describe "ImagePublisher" do
</code></pre>
<p>Ran <code>rspec</code> and ALL THE TESTS PASSED!!!</p>
<p>Now, I have no clue why rspec was passing the classes' test and failing an unrelated test just because a describe block was named how it should be named. I had other tests named similarly for files in <code>spec/lib</code>, but the only difference there was that they were inside module folders and named with the namespace of that module, while this test wasn't.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, this weird test fixed my woes, but I'd be glad if someone can tell me what I was doing wrong in the first place by not putting the describe block title in quotes. OR, you can tell me where I can find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor">Occam</a> so I can kill him. Till then, I'll chalk this one up as cosmic karma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I figured out why all this happened. In the ImagePublisher class, I had extended the string class by doing a "Class String" instead of "String.class_eval", which basically FUBARed any other string functions elsewhere.</p>
